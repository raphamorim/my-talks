# My talks

> Yes, even my slides are open :)

These are my slides of talks I've ever done. If you want to fix something or add some information feel free.

You can have PR for repairs, but to add information to the slides I prefer issues.

Oh! You can find all information about my talks [here](http://raphamorim.com/talks).
